# DeepL_medical_Imaging
IMI Department Project

In collaboration with Gense Technologies, our project aims at generating EIT images for clinical purposes. We implement a new approach for solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems lying on deep learning.

## Important remark
If you want to run those programs, you will need to clone the PyEIT pipeline available here : https://github.com/liubenyuan/pyEIT
We advice you to add the path of the folder pyeit to you environment variables that is to say that you have to add this path to your Pythonpath.
